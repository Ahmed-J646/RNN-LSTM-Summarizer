LSTM Text Generation with Streamlit
This project demonstrates text generation using a trained LSTM model, implemented in TensorFlow/Keras, and deployed as a simple and interactive Streamlit app. The app generates text based on user-provided seed text and a Shakespeare-inspired dataset.

Features
Generate text using an LSTM model trained on Shakespeare-like data.
Input your own seed text to customize the generated content.
Control the number of words to generate using an intuitive slider.
Clean and user-friendly Streamlit interface.

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-J646/RNN-LSTM-Summarizer.git
cd lstm-text-generator
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required Python packages:


pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Prepare the Model and Tokenizer
Train your LSTM model using the script in this repository or load an existing trained model.
Save your model as model.h5:

model.save("model.h5")
Save your tokenizer using pickle:
python

import pickle
with open("tokenizer.pkl", "wb") as file:
    pickle.dump(tokenizer, file)
Place both the model.h5 and tokenizer.pkl files in the root directory of the project.

4. Run the Streamlit App
Run the following command to launch the app:


streamlit run app.py
How to Use the App
Enter a seed text (e.g., shall i compare thee).
Use the slider to select the number of words to generate.
Click the "Generate Text" button to view the output.
Experiment with different inputs and see how the model responds.
